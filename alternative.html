    <h1>Alternative investments</h1><!-- Big topic -->
    <p>Although investing in cryptocurrencies is known for high risk, there are alternative 
    investment methods that have lower risks or even more complicated revenue-generating methods. 
    This page will introduce ways of investments that you usually will not find, or less popular in traditional markets.</p>
    <h2>Mining</h2><!-- Sub topic --><!-- How BTC works should be already mentioned in other section so I will not include here. -->
    <p>Mining is an investment method which is only possible in cryptocurrencies market. 
    As cryptocurrencies is a decentralized system, we need machines all around the world for verifications of the transections. 
    Miners, will be doing the transections, and collect revenues for each transsections. To start mining, you need: </p>
    <ul><!-- List -->
        <li>A pc with a good GPU, or even, a special machine like AntMiner</li>
        <li>A crypto wallet</li>
        <li>A mining software (Miner)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>With these hardware and software, you can start using your rig to verify transections. With each successful 
    verification, you will receive some BTC for reward.</p>
    <p>Feeling confused? Start with <a href="https://www.nicehash.com/" target="_blank">NiceHash</a>, a mining software for beginners!</p>
    <p>Once you got that on hand, you may start working on some advanced topic like overclocking, undervolting, cracking NVIDIA's LHR, etc. 
    To squeeze the profit from your GPU.</p>
    <h2>Robot trading</h2><!-- Sub topic -->
    <p>Even in this crazy crypto market. There still exists stable income. For example, the Cash and Futures Arbitrage robot in 
    <a href="https://www.pionex.com/" target="_blank">Pionex</a>. Which can bring about 5% - 50% revenue yearly. It make use of Biance's 
    funding rate and it's system, do the trading every 8 hours, earn the difference made between the futures of a crypto and its actual price. 
    Although it ain't much, but is stable compare to the other crypto trading. If this looks too dull for you, there are also different kind of
    trading bots like the Grid trading bot. As the market in crypto is 24-7, no one will be able to work on the market in all trading hours, 
    with robots, we can then fill the gap.</p>
