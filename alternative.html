    <p>Even in this crazy crypto market. There still exists stable income. For example, the Cash and Futures Arbitrage robot in 
    <a href="https://www.pionex.com/" target="_blank">Pionex</a>. Which can bring about 5% - 50% revenue yearly. It make use of Biance's 
    funding rate and it's system, do the trading every 8 hours, earn the difference made between the futures of a crypto and its actual price.

    trading bots like the Grid trading bot. As the market in crypto is 24-7, no one will be able to work on the market in all trading hours, 
    with robots, we can then fill the gap.</p>
